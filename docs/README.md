Dear Red:

<div style="text-indent: 2em;">
If you're reading this, you've gotten out.
And if you've come this far, maybe you're willing to come a little further.
You remember the name of the town, don't you?
</div>

<div style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 2em;">
Remember, Red. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.
</div>

<div style="text-align: right; margin-top: 2em;">
Your friend.
</div>
